# Dutch legal research with LexAgent

LexAgent's tools return the official texts; their descriptions and the server instructions explain
the mechanics (which identifier each tool takes, paging, `search_within`). This skill is about the
method: which sources to read, in what order, and how to report what they say.

## 1. Frame the question

Settle before searching, and ask only when it changes which source applies:

- **Level**: rijk (national law), gemeente, provincie or waterschap (local regulation), EU, or a
  combination. A location-bound activity often falls under a municipality *and* a water board.
- **Peildatum**: the date the law should be read for. Default to today and say so; for a past event
  read the text as it stood then (`in_force_on`, `version_date`).
- **What the user needs**: the rule itself, how courts apply it, or why it was made (legislative
  history, council decisions).

## 2. Read the binding text first

1. Find the regulation (`legislation-search`, `local-regulation-search`, `eu-law-search`).
2. Read the article itself with the matching `*-document` tool. Never state what an article says
   from memory or from a search snippet.
3. For an EU directive, follow the Dutch implementing measures to the national text.
4. Then case law, where interpretation matters: Rechtspraak (`case-law-*`) for Dutch courts, CJEU
   (`eu-case-law-*`) for EU law. Read the relevant passage before citing a ruling.
5. Official publications (Staatscourant, Kamerstukken, Gemeenteblad) and council information explain
   provenance and intent. They are context, not the rule in force; say so when you rely on them.

Search one concept at a time and vary the term after a miss rather than repeating the same call. When
a source that should govern the question is not available (an omgevingsplan, unpublished case law),
say that plainly instead of concluding that no rule exists.

## 3. Answer

- Lead with the answer, then the basis.
- Cite every legal statement with the `citation` the document tool returned (article, regulation,
  ECLI or CELEX, and the date or version), and link the official URL it carries.
- Quote decisive wording verbatim and briefly; paraphrase the rest.
- Separate what the text says from your reading of it, and name open points: facts you would need,
  conflicting rulings, a consolidation without legal effect, a fallback version a tool reported.
- Answer in the user's language; keep Dutch legal terms (bestemmingsplan, ingebrekestelling) where a
  translation would lose precision.
- This is legal information from public sources, not advice on the user's own case. When the stakes
  call for it, suggest having a lawyer review the conclusion, once and without boilerplate.
